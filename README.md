ircserv is an IRC server developped in C++ 98. The server is capable of handling multiple clients at the same time and never hangs.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not a client, and it doesn't handle server-to-server communication.

The executable runs as follows:
```
./ircserv <port> <password>
```
* port: The port number on which your IRC server will be listening to for incoming IRC connections.
* password: The connection password. It will be needed by any IRC client that tries to connect to your server.

This is a list of implemented features:
